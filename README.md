# USD Mercury
USD Mercury is an innovative tool designed to streamline the setup of a complete VFX/CGI pipeline leveraging Universal Scene Description (USD). This solution is ideal for both individual artists and collaborative group projects. The core of USD Mercury is developed in Python, incorporating various APIs to ensure seamless integration with different Digital Content Creation tools (DCCs).

## Features
-   Unified Pipeline: Leverage the power of USD to unify your project's pipeline.
-   Extensible Integration: Compatible with multiple DCCs via API integration.
-   User-Friendly Interface: GUI developed in PySide2/PyQt5 for ease of use.
-   Project Tracking: Initially using SQLite for project tracking, with plans to migrate to Shotgun API for enhanced project management capabilities.

## Overview
### USD Asset Creation
The assets generated by the plugin adhere to the structuring guidelines set forth by the ASWF (Academy Software Foundation's Universal Scene Description Working Group). For detailed information on these guidelines, please refer to the [ASWF Asset Structure Guideline.](https://github.com/usd-wg/assets/blob/main/docs/asset-structure-guidelines.md)

In addition to complying with ASWF standards, my approach integrates methodologies from the [Alab scene by Animal Logic.](https://usd-alab2.s3.amazonaws.com/documentation.html)
. Specifically, Iâ€™ve adopted the Alab methodology of Entities and Fragments, which influences the asset construction logic and folder management practices. Further details on this methodology can be found in the Alab AnimalLogic Documentation.
#### Modelling Department
In the Asset Modeling Department, Autodesk Maya serves as the primary modeling Digital Content Creation (DCC) tool. The plugin enhances Maya's capabilities by structuring outputs using the geo variant set logic. This logic facilitates the conversion of Maya's internal geometric data into a format readable by USD. Key conversions performed by the plugin include:

-   Extent: This defines the axis-aligned bounding box for the mesh, which is used for spatial partitioning, culling, and other optimizations. It's defined by the minimum and maximum corners.
-   Face Vertex Counts: This is an array where each element specifies the number of vertices that make up each face of the mesh. In this file, each face has 4 vertices, which typically means the -    mesh is composed of quads.
-   Face Vertex Indices: This array defines the indices into the points array for each vertex of each face, essentially which points are used to define each face.
-   Normals.
-   3D points: This array defines the 3D coordinates for each vertex of the mesh.
-   Display Color: This is a color array that specifies the color to be used when displaying the mesh in a viewer
-   Texture Coordinates:  This array defines the texture coordinates for the mesh, necessary for applying textures.
-   Texture Indices: This array of indices maps the texture coordinates to the mesh vertices.

Additionally, the plugin is responsible for constructing the main hierarchy of the asset. It defines the root primitive, class inheritance, and sets the purpose for render and proxy meshes. It also manages variant sets, including the creation of variants and setting default variants.

By leveraging intermediate USD files (lightweight files that reference heavier geometric data in .usdc or .usda formats), the plugin allows users to pin or unpin the current version of the payload that each asset variant uses, overriding the latest publication. This feature enhances version control and scene management within the production pipeline.
